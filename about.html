<p>Hi, I’m Agnes.</p>

<p>I’m part of the Online Software Engineering cohort starting on Jan 21.</p>

<p>I grew up in Staten Island, so I’m an original New Yorker depending on who you ask. I have since ditched the ferry rides to live in the trendier borough of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>I’m a creative people-person that loves math and science. In college, I was a Biology and Theatre double major and Math minor. For the past two years, I’ve worked as a clinical research coordinator at NYU Langone, where my responsibilities have spanned from collecting data on cardiac arrest patients to interviewing people about the health impacts of their socioeconomic circumstances.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to sing, cook food for my friends, and read books about why people and society do things. This blog will be dedicated to my thoughts and experiences as I attempt to juggle that, my job, and a software engineering bootcamp. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading!
</p>
