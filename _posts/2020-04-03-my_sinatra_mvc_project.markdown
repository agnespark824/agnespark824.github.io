My Sinatra MVC project is called SongWriter. It is a CMS that allows users to write down and develop original song lyrics and create performance setlists. The app requires users to create an account and log in for each session of songwriting. The models for my app are either associated through the belongs_to/has_many  relationship (i.e. a song belongs to a user and a user has many songs) or the belongs_to_and_has_many relationship (e.g. a song belongs to and has many setlists). 

This project took me a really long time to finish but it really helped me piece together everything we had learned over the past few weeks. Throughout this module, I found myself forgetting the groundwork SQL concepts as the level of abstraction increased. As I stumbled through this project, I put in a lot of effort to really understand every line of code I was writing. I feel way more confident now than I did at the start of the project!
