At the end of last year, I decided to seriously explore my career options and plan a path forward.

I had been working as a clinical research coordinator for two years and felt a lot of uncertainty about what my next steps were going to be. While I found the work that I was doing to be very meaningful, I wanted to be able to contribute to healthcare research in a more significant way. However, I was not interested in pursuing a PhD, which essentially made it impossible to advance my career in the sciences. I wanted a job where I could solve complex problems and create things using my brain.

When I learned about Flatiron's online software engineering bootcamp, I immediately knew that it was the path I needed to take. Programming feels like the perfect application of my science, math, and art backgrounds, and provides a specialized skillset that is relevant to every field. I hope that my journey will one day lead me back to research, where there is growing interest in using telehealth platforms to deliver health-related interventions. Until then, I am very, very excited to be here!
